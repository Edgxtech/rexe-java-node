# Resource Exchange Engine (ReXe)

Extended Java IPFS Node with added Distributed Execution. 
Extends: [Nabu](https://github.com/Peergos/nabu),
Based On: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

## Status
This is a concept demonstration.

Currently implemented:
* Distributed Execution via an extended Bitswap (eBitSwap) protocol

## Aim
The aim is to build a proof of concept providing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) 'Resource Exchange' abilities covering files, data 
and Distributed Procedures (DPs).

It extends the IPFS Bitswap protocol to enable deployment and execution of 'Distributed Procedures' (DPs) which can be 
programmed to do anything. Distributed Execution is an extension/companion of IPFS Distributed Filesystem, together 
they provide DATA and NON-DATA uniquely identified 'Resource' addressing and P2P distribution.
