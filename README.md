# Resource Exchange Engine (Rexe)

Extended Java IPFS Node with added Distributed Execution 
Extends: [Nabu] (https://github.com/Peergos/nabu)
Design Pattern: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

## Status
This is research and a WIP.

Currently implemented:
* Distributed Execution via an extended Bitswap (eBitSwap) protocol

## Aim
The goal is to build a proof of concept Distributed Resources Framework (DRF) for network layer abstraction. Rexe is intended to be a component providing P2P Resource Exchange abilities covering files, data and Distributed Procedures (DPs).

Distributed Execution is an extension/companion of IPFS Distributed Filesystem
Together they provide DATA and NON-DATA Uniquely identified Resource Addressing and P2P Distribution
Other components of DRF will provide; PKI, user identity, priorities management and administration application(s).

A Whitepaper will be added soon describing the aim and approach in detail
